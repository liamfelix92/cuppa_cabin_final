### Colour Scheme
    The colour scheme was requested by the owner of the Cuppa Cabin as they match their existing branding, including loyalty cards
    This included a Malachite green as a border, which made up the bulk of the colour used across the site, accented with a Medium Purple,
    matching the coffee machine and existing sign at the premises. I experimented with adding other colours to try and help accentuate, which began to make the 
    layout look untidy. Using only the three allowed for a bold and clean look, making information very clear.

### Typography
    Google Fonts was used to import the two fonts used accross the website. Caveat was used for headings and links as I was looking for an easy to read cursive or handwritten font. A number of different options were attempted, with many which seemed fitting at desktop view not suitable for viewing on smaller devices. Caveat sat perfectly inbetween seeming handwritten but completely legible at all sizes.  Roboto was selected for the main body text due to its clean design and ease of reading. Allows for the main body text to be clear and understandable accross all pages. 

    Font Awesome was used for the footer icons displaying links to Instagram and Facebook.
