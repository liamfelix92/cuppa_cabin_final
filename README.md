### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was requested by the owner of the Cuppa Cabin as they match their existing branding, including loyalty cards
This included a Malachite green as a border, which made up the bulk of the colour used across the site, accented with a Medium Purple,
matching the coffee machine and existing sign at the premises. I experimented with adding other colours to try and help accentuate, which began to make the 
layout look untidy. Using only the three allowed for a bold and clean look, making information very clear.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the two fonts used accross the website. Caveat was used for headings and links as I was looking for an easy to read cursive or handwritten font. A number of different options were attempted, with many which seemed fitting at desktop view not suitable for viewing on smaller devices. Caveat sat perfectly inbetween seeming handwritten but completely legible at all sizes.  Roboto was selected for the main body text due to its clean design and ease of reading. Allows for the main body text to be clear and understandable accross all pages. 

Font Awesome was used for the footer icons displaying links to Instagram and Facebook. 

## Features

This website has standard features such as a navigational bar and footer, features which internet users will be familiar with. This allows for ease of navigation and comfortable user experience. 


### Home Page

#### Navigational Bar

The navbar for each page is responsive and collapses into a hamburger at mobile screens and horizontal orientation on certain devices. The title is a link to return to the home page and when a page is active, it is displayed in bold for ease of navigation.

#### Footer

The footer for each page is simple and includes links to the Cuppa Cabin's social media pages on Instagram and Facebook. 

![Footer](documentation/testing/footer.jpg)

#### Hero Image

The primary use for the home page is to display the basic information for the Cuppa Cabin, including the address and opening hours. This also includes a link to the Sheds page to allow for frequent visitors easy access to the booking modal. 

![Home Hero Image](documentation/testing/hero-image.jpg)

#### Map

The home page also includes an interactive map imported from Google Maps showing the location of the Cuppa Cabin. This includes the option to view a larger map which opens in a new tab to allow customers to generate directions. 

![Home Google Map](documentation/testing/google-map.jpg)

### Sheds Page

#### Main Body

The main body of the sheds page is used to display an image of each available shed to book and an explaination of the suggested numbers. This is done on a responsive grid system which lays out the information based on the device being used. This is placed on a dark background to match the opaque nature of the hero image for consistency across the site.

#### Booking Modal

The booking modal's content is supplied by SimplyBook's Widget services, this is a live booking service which the Cuppa Cabin currently uses. It allows the visitor to book a time slot for their desired shed with ease.

### Workshops Page

#### Main Body

The main body of the workshop page is used to display information for the upcoming workshops being ran, including their price. This is done on a responsive grid system which lays out the information based on the device being used. This is placed on a dark background to match the opaque nature of the hero image for consistency across the site.

![Workshops Main Body](documentation/testing/workshops-images.jpg)

#### Enquiry Modal

The modal is used for an enquiry form. The form includes checkboxes, allowing the visitor to enquire about multiple workshops at once. 

![Workshops Modal](documentation/testing/workshop-modal.jpg)

### Menu Page

This page displays the current menu for the Cuppa Cabin so that visitors can view it before visiting. There is also a download button to allow for the PDF copy to be saved to a device. 

![Menu Page](documentation/testing/menu-page.jpg)

### Contact Page 

The contact page displays a clean contact form to easily enquire about anything in regards to the cuppa cabin. It sits at the end of the links as a natural end to the user journey, in case any of their questions have not been answered by the information displayed. For this project, the submit validates the form only.
