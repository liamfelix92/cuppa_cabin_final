# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essential
    The Cuppa Cabin is a website to promote and facilitate the business The Cuppa Cabin, which offers food and drink as well as the rental of cabins to relax in.
    This site is intended to bring new customers to the business, but also offer returning customers simple booking options.

### Wireframes
    The Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq. The final site varies from the wireframes due to developments that occurred during the building process.

### Colour Scheme
    The colour scheme was requested by the owner of the Cuppa Cabin as they match their existing branding, including loyalty cards
    This included a Malachite green as a border, which made up the bulk of the colour used across the site, accented with a Medium Purple,
    matching the coffee machine and existing sign at the premises. I experimented with adding other colours to try and help accentuate, which began to make the 
    layout look untidy. Using only the three allowed for a bold and clean look, making information very clear.

### Typography
    Google Fonts was used to import the two fonts used accross the website. Caveat was used for headings and links as I was looking for an easy to read cursive or handwritten font. A number of different options were attempted, with many which seemed fitting at desktop view not suitable for viewing on smaller devices. Caveat sat perfectly inbetween seeming handwritten but completely legible at all sizes.  Roboto was selected for the main body text due to its clean design and ease of reading. Allows for the main body text to be clear and understandable accross all pages. 

    Font Awesome was used for the footer icons displaying links to Instagram and Facebook. 

## Features
    This website has standard features such as a navigational bar and footer, features which internet users will be familiar with. This allows for ease of navigation and comfortable user experience. 


### Home Page

#### Navigational Bar

The navbar for each page is responsive and collapses into a hamburger at mobile screens and horizontal orientation on certain devices. The title is a link to return to the home page and when a page is active, it is displayed in bold for ease of navigation.

#### Footer

The footer for each page is simple and includes links to the Cuppa Cabin's social media pages on Instagram and Facebook.

#### Hero Image

The primary use for the home page is to display the basic information for the Cuppa Cabin, including the address and opening hours. This also includes a link to the Sheds page to allow for frequent visitors easy access to the booking modal.

#### Map

The home page also includes an interactive map imported from Google Maps showing the location of the Cuppa Cabin. This includes the option to view a larger map which opens in a new tab to allow customers to generate directions.

### Sheds Page

#### Main Body

The main body of the sheds page is used to display an image of each available shed to book and an explaination of the suggested numbers. This is placed on a dark background to match the opaque nature of the hero image for consistency across the site.
