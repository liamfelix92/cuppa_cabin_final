# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essential
    The Cuppa Cabin is a website to promote and facilitate the business The Cuppa Cabin, which offers food and drink as well as the rental of cabins to relax in.
    This site is intended to bring new customers to the business, but also offer returning customers simple booking options.

## UX
    The site was thought out with a mobile-first design as this is the type of device I expect the user to most often visit the website from. I chose to use Bootstrap 4.5 as it allowed for a clean interface and layout of information. The site is designed with minimal features to focus on those which most directly benefit the user experience. 
### User Stories
   * As a user I would like to ensure my favourite shed is available so that I can enjoy my visit more. 
   * As a user I want to be able to enquire about upcoming workshops so that I can save time. 
   * As a user I want to be able to contact the business so that I can enquire about dietry options. 
   * As a user I want to be able to plan my trip for peace of mind. 
   * As a user I want to be able to see what other customers think before deciding to visit. 
   * As a user I want to be able to check what food and drink they offer before visiting.
