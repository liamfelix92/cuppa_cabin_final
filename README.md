### Wireframes
    include screenshots of your wireframes (consider the markdown table format) 

### Colour Scheme
    The colour scheme was requested by the owner of the Cuppa Cabin as they match their existing branding, including loyalty cards
    This included a Malachite green as a border, which made up the bulk of the colour used across the site, accented with a Medium Purple,
    matching the coffee machine and existing sign at the premises. I experimented with adding other colours to try and help accentuate, which began to make the 
    layout look untidy. Using only the three allowed for a bold and clean look, making information very clear. 

### Typography
    Google Fonts - Roboto for the main body text and Caveat for headings and links. 
    Font Awesome - Used for Facebook and Instagram links in footer.
