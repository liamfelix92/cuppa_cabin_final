## Lighthouse 

I Used Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - How accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best Practices - How does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

After some below 90 scores on initial mobile tests, I compressed the site images and re-tested each page. On these secondary tests, no score came below 94.

- as an example, the results for the Pawsome Pawtraits Home Page for both Mobile & Desktop are below.
