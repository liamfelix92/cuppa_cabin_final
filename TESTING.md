## Lighthouse 

![Lighthouse Check](documentation/testing/lighthouse-check.png)

The Lighthouse check has returned a sub-optimal performance. 

![Lighthouse Fails](documentation/testing/lighthouse-fails.jpg)

A number of these appear to be related to the use of Bootstrap and the Google Maps iframe element. This could be improved dramatically through changes to efficiency which, for the purposes of this project, I am unable to rectify at the time. 


## Responsiveness 

Responsive design tests were carried out using both physical devices and [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). 

### Physical Device Tests:

#### Samsung Galaxy s10

#### iPhone X

#### iPhone SE

The only device where I feel that the landing page is poorly optimised, however, the share of SE devices among iPhone users is approximately only 2.3%.

#### Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra

## Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox, with no visible issues for the user. Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers, besides Safari, which seems to struggle with load times occasionally.
