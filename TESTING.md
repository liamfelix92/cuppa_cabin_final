## Lighthouse 

![Lighthouse Check](documentation/testing/lighthouse-check.png)

The Lighthouse check has returned a sub-optimal performance.

A number of these appear to be related to the use of Bootstrap and the Google Maps iframe element. This could be improved dramatically through changes to efficiency which, for the purposes of this project, I am unable to rectify at the time. 


## Responsiveness 

Responsive design tests were carried out manually using the following devices with no issues found. 

This included:
- Samsung s10, s21
- Google Pixel 4a, 6 Pro
- Iphone 12, 
- Ipad Air & Mini

## Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox, with no visible issues for the user. Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers, besides Safari, which seems to struggle with load times occasionally.
